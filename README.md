random bits of useful code for Y6 analysis

## things you can find here

 - code to blind shear catalogs
 - code to make cuts on metadetection shear catalogs
 - code to make plots of cell-based "pizza slice" coadds
 - random other things like a JAX-based PSF modeling code

## other places to look for Y6 code

 - beckermr/pizza-cutter: makes cell-based "pizza slice" coadds
 - beckermr/pizza-cutter-metadetect: runs metadetect over the cell-based "pizza slice" coadds and has code to make coadd images from pizza slices
 - beckermr/pizza-cutter-masking: makes masks for metadetection shear catalogs
 - esheldon/pizza-patches: makes final JK patch catalogs for metadetect shear catalogs
